# SoccerSense Project 

## Overview
This project, **SoccerSense**, is a comprehensive soccer analytics platform that integrates multiple data sources, including structured CSV datasets, unstructured video data, and semi-structured JSON files. The primary goal is to address challenges in soccer analytics by providing automated data ingestion, advanced AI-driven analysis, and real-time insights for coaches, analysts, and scouts.

### üåê 1.Data Sources
Here I have used a variety of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data.
#### Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores
#### Transfermarkt: https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/
#### Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/

### üóÇÔ∏è 2. Landing Zone
- **Temporal Landing Zone**  
  Stores raw data including:
  - CSVs (match/player stats)
  - JSON (YouTube comments)
  - MP4 (match videos)

- **Persistent Landing Zone**  
  Cleaned data is written using **Delta Lake** to support:
  - ACID-compliant transactional storage
  - Metadata management and schema enforcement



### üîê 3. Trusted Zone
- **PySpark** is used for:
  - Large-scale data cleaning and consistency checks
  - Video metadata processing
  - Parsing and structuring YouTube comments
- Data is stored in **DuckDB** for in-memory analytics



### üìà 4. Exploitation Zone
- KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) such as player performance and win rates are computed using **PySpark**
- Results are saved in **Parquet** format for downstream consumption



### üßë‚Äçüíª 5. Consumption Zone
A **Streamlit** web application provides:

- üé• **Video Detection Module**  
  Uses **YOLOv8** to detect and track players and ball movement

- üí¨ **Sentiment Analysis Module**  
  Applies **VADER** to classify YouTube comments by emotional tone

- üìä **KPI Dashboard Module**  
  Built with **Streamlit + DuckDB**, enabling:
  - CSV upload & table preview
  - Custom SQL querying
  - Dynamic visualization using **Matplotlib**
